# HIV-1 Tat modifies expression of host genes in B cells

This repo contains code used to obtain results and figures in the article **Ectopic expression of HIV-1 Tat modifies gene expression in cultured B cells: Implications for the development of B-cell lymphomas in HIV-1-infected patients**.

The raw and processed RNA-seq data (fastq files and gene counts) are deposited in GEO with accession number [GSE182538](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE182538).

*Note:* because of multiple possible conflicts between different R packages (e.g. `dplyr` and `clusterProfiler`) try running each script in separate R sessions.
