# HIV-1 Tat modifies expression of host genes in B cells

This repo contains code used to obtain results and figures ***not published yet*** in the article **HIV-1 Tat modifies expression of host genes in B cells: possible implications for development of B-cell lymphomas in HIV-1-infected patients**.

The raw and processed RNA-seq data (fastq files and gene counts) are deposited in GEO with accession number GSE182538.

*Note:* because of multiple possible conflicts between different R packages (e.g. `dplyr` and `clusterProfiler`) try running each script in separate R sessions.
